# Market Data Processing & Quantitative Analytics System

This repository contains an actively developed Python-based system for collecting, cleaning, and statistically labeling high-frequency market data. The system focuses on quantitative signal analysis rather than automated trading.

The project uses custom DuckDB databases and statistical methods (z-scores, rolling averages, and volatility metrics) to normalize price, volume, and volatility data and evaluate signal strength and consistency over time.

This is a data engineering and analysis project, not a production trading system.
